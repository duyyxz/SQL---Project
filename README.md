🔍 Business Problem
Warehouse managers need a robust inventory management system to efficiently track stock levels, manage incoming and outgoing shipments, and optimize storage capacity. The challenge is handling large volumes of inventory data while ensuring real-time accuracy and accessibility for decision-making.

💡 Solution Approach
To address this, I designed a structured relational database using SQL Server, ensuring optimized storage and efficient querying. The solution includes:
✅ Schema Design: Well-defined tables for customers, warehouses, items, inventory transactions, and stock levels.
✅ Data Processing: SQL queries to track stock movement, monitor inventory changes, and detect low-stock alerts.
✅ Interactive Dashboard: Utilizing Power BI / Tableau, I visualize key metrics like stock trends, warehouse utilization, and transaction summaries.

📊 Expected Outcomes
📌 Improved inventory accuracy and tracking.
📌 Real-time insights into stock movement and warehouse performance.
📌 Enhanced decision-making through interactive reports and dashboards.
